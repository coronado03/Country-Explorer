# Country Explorer

This is a web application that allows you to generate a random list of countries based on a continent and a desired number of countries. The application uses a combination of GraphQL and REST APIs to fetch country data and display it on the page.

## Getting Started

To get started with the application, you'll need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed on your machine. Once you've cloned the repository, navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

```
npm install
```

## Usage

To start the application, run the following command:

```
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server and launch the application in your default web browser.

Once the application is running, you can select a continent from the dropdown menu and specify the number of countries you would like to generate using the input field. Click the "Submit" button to generate a random list of countries based on your selections.
